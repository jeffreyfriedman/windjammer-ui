# Editor Unification Summary

## What Was Done

Successfully unified the Windjammer Game Editor following the user's feedback to:
1. Make game framework panels **dockable** (not just floating)
2. Consolidate to a **single editor binary** (no "professional" or "enhanced" variants)
3. Follow Windjammer's "one way to do things" philosophy

## Changes Made

### 1. Consolidated Editor Binaries ✅

**Before:**
- `editor_professional.rs` - Full editor
- `editor_enhanced.rs` - Test variant
- Confusing naming suggesting quality differences

**After:**
- `editor.rs` - Single, unified, production-grade editor
- Clean, simple entry point
- No quality tier implications

### 2. Made All Panels Dockable ✅

**Before:**
- Core editor panels: Dockable tabs
- Game framework panels: Floating windows
- Inconsistent UX

**After:**
- **All panels are dockable tabs**
- Consistent professional UX
- Can be dragged, docked, undocked, rearranged
- Accessed via View menu

### 3. Simplified Architecture ✅

**Removed:**
- `GameFrameworkPanels` struct (no longer needed)
- `render_game_framework_panels` function (deprecated)
- Floating window system for game panels

**Added:**
- 11 game framework panel types to `PanelType` enum
- `add_panel_to_dock` helper function
- View menu integration for all panels
- Rendering logic in `TabViewer::ui`

## Available Panels
